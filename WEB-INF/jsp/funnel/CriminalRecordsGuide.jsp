<h2>I. THE TRUTH ABOUT CRIMINAL RECORDS</h2>

<p>There <em>is</em> a true nationwide criminal record  database in the U.S.  It’s the FBI’s NCIC database, but it isn’t  available to the public.&nbsp; The rules for public access to criminal records  are established at the state level.  If  you’re an individual or a business doing a background check you have to abide  by state criminal record regulations, and each state has different rules about  who may access their records and how the records will be provided.  To make it even more confusing, many states  leave it up to the counties to decide if and how you may access those  records.  And if you want to find  criminal records information on the Internet it’s a difficult and frustrating  task to determine who offers what, whether that information is online, and  where to find it.</p>

<p>It’s a  criminal record maze, and we’ll help you find your way through it with: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>This “Guide” to help you find the  information you need;</li>
    <li>Our SearchSystems.net public  records directory which contains over 45,000 hand-picked links to online public  record databases, including thousands of links to criminal court records,  “wanted” lists and databases, warrants, arrests, bookings, inmate, parole, and  sex offender databases, as well as links to information on how to order  criminal histories from state agencies—all organized nationwide and by state  and category so that they are easy to find; and </li>
    <li>The SearchSystems.Net Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal Records Database, the single largest database of criminal records  available to the public—over 300 million county, state, national, and  international records.</li>
  </ol>

<p><strong>If you’d like to search for criminal records, it’s easy:</strong></p>

<p>Perform a “Non-Member Search” of our Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database of 300 Million+ records.  No membership is required.  The cost is $9.95 for a statewide search, or  $19.95 for a search of all state, national, and international records in our  database.  Click   <a href="${landingUrl}">here</a> to start your search.

<h2>II. QUESTIONS ABOUT CRIMINAL RECORDS</h2>

<p>Here are some common questions about finding criminal  records on the Internet.</p>

<h1>Is there a true “National” U.S.  criminal record database and may I access it?</h1>

<p>There is a national database, <strong>but it is NOT available to the public</strong>.  The FBI maintains a host computer that  provides access to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computerized  index of criminal justice information, (as well as fugitives, stolen  properties, and missing persons). It is available <strong>ONLY</strong> to federal, state, and local law enforcement and other  criminal justice agencies.  The FBI  claims that <em>virtually</em> all local  criminal justice agencies participate in this system.
</p>

<h1>What about the databases provided by private companies?  Do they provide access to all criminal  records?</h1>

<p>No private company or service can provide public access to  all criminal records and there are three basic reasons for that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some  states and counties want to control access to criminal records and only provide  that information online themselves.</li>
  <li>Some  states will not allow the public to have access to statewide criminal records  or will only provide those records through a state-sponsored service.</li>
  <li>There are many counties that don't have the  capability to gather and redistribute their criminal record information online  to the public.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Then what is the best method to search criminal records?</h1>

<p>A hand-search of local records will allow you to search for  all variations on a name, catch misspellings or inaccurate birth dates, and get  in-depth records and document copies.   But hand searches can be time-consuming and expensive—especially if you  have to cover a large number of jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Using the Internet, you can have the next best thing –  instant research from the comfort of your home or office (or the local  MegaCoffee shop that has WiFi).  However,  be aware of both the benefits and limitations to criminal records searching on  the web.  We wrote this guide to help  with your online research using a combination of methods—to minimize the  potential information gaps found with online searching.</p>

<h1>How do I evaluate an online criminal or public record service?</h1>

<p>First of all, start with the coverage.  How many records do they provide?  Do they list their coverage and is it  detailed, or do they just list the states and lead you to assume that their  search covers everything?  Do they  provide any details as to what counties are covered?  Are they forthright about who they are, or do  they hide their ownership?  Try doing a “<a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/index.jsp"><strong>whois</strong></a>” search to find out who owns the web site you want to  evaluate—are they hiding ownership behind a “proxy” registration service?  Are you able to send them an email?  Do you get a response?  If so, what sort of customer service do you  get?  Make sure that you can identify who  they are, that they provide good customer service, and that you’re getting the  most records, coverage, and current information available.  Otherwise, why even do the search?</p>

<h1>If I use SearchSystems.net, where do I start?</h1>

<p>If you don’t plan to do regular searches and want the most  “bang for the buck,” we recommend a <u><a href="${landingUrl}">Non-Member Search</a></u> by name and birth date of all 300 million+ records in our  Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database.</p>

<p>If you plan to do more than one search and want to do  thorough and comprehensive searches, become a SearchSystems.net member, which  gives you access to our 300 million+  Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database and our Criminal Records Directory where you’ll find  links to court records, inmate records, wants, warrants, and sex offender  databases provided directly online by the public agencies that compile the  records.  The directory also provides  links to online state-run criminal record services, and information on how to  order a statewide search directly from a State Agency.  Members receive significant discounts  on their Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database searches.</p>

<p>Best results come  from using both our Criminal Records Directory and our  Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database.  Any results returned by the instant records in  our <u><a href="${landingUrl}">Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database</a></u>  can  be followed up with a search in the Directory of the particular county (or counties)  where the offense(s) appear.  This is  where the links in the Directory can be useful to get even more details (such  as docket information and defendant addresses) on a criminal case.  Or, start with the Directory and follow it up  with a Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database search to uncover more records.</p>

<p>The Directory  simply gives you a huge advantage over using a single online database.  For example, a true New York statewide criminal record search is  only available through the New York State Court service—and we provide a link  to it in our Directory.  Same with Massachusetts— the only way to access Massachusetts criminal records is through  the state, and we provide a link to that resource as well. Another example is Nevada.  We provide access to Nevada corrections  records in our Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database (the same as any other private online  provider), but in our Criminal Records Directory we also provide access to  information on how to obtain criminal histories from the Nevada Department of  Public Safety, a direct link to the   statewide Department of Corrections inmate database, Clark County (Las  Vegas Area) court records, Washoe County (Reno Area) court records, the Nevada  U.S. District Court PACER criminal and civil records database, as well as  county and city links to inmate databases and crime maps.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that  both systems have advantages and disadvantages.   The Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database search covers a large number of records at once and  therefore saves time.  The Criminal  Records Directory allows you do searches yourself, gives you greater detail,  and provides access to databases not covered by larger all-inclusive state and  nationwide databases, but takes more time.</p>

<p>Best results come  from using both.</p>

<h1>What if I don’t know where a  record is located?</h1>

<p>Then we suggest  that you use our <u><a href="${landingUrl}">Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal Record Database</a></u>, where we provide the largest  single database of criminal records available on the Internet. </p>

<h1>What areas are covered in the SearchSystems.net Criminal Records Directory?</h1>

<p>Check our <a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=494">Criminal Records Directory</a> area for a complete listing of every international, national, state, county,  and city database that we’ve been able to locate online since we started this  service in 1996.</p>

<h1>What is covered in the SearchSystems.net Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal Records Database?</h1>

<p>For a complete  listing of all of our Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal Record Database sources, <a href="https://premium.searchsystems.net/searches/criminal_databases_new.php">click  here</a> and you will find a directory that lists all the sources for our  database of over 300 million records and includes detail on each international,  national, state, and county sources.   Review this carefully if you’re going to compare this service against  other data providers.</p>

<h1>How current is the Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database data?</h1>

<p>An online search is only as accurate as the agency reporting  the data.  Our <a href="https://www.searchsystems.net/springapp/funnel/ourDatabases.do">Criminal  Records Data Sources</a> page lists the sources and update frequency for each  jurisdiction that provides criminal records.  Information that is provided  directly online by a public agency is going to be the most current—another good  reason to use our Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database AND our Criminal Records  Directory.</p>

<h1>What information will I find in the Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database?</h1>

<p>Each jurisdiction provides a different amount of information  and utilizes different sources. Results may include charges, case information,  gender, race, and address. Court Records may include case information, charges,  and/or case records.</p>

<h1>Where do I find Wants, Warrants, and Arrests?</h1>

<p>Most wants, warrants, and arrests aren’t technically  criminal records as there hasn’t been a conviction or disposition yet, so you  won’t find those in our Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database.  The place to find wants, warrants, and  arrests is in our <a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=494">Criminal Records Directory</a>.  Browse by state for links to national, state,  county, and city lists and databases.</p>

<h1>Where do I find Federal Court Records?</h1>

<p>Federal cases are not included in our Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database.  The best resource for  searching federal court records is the PACER system, which covers civil, criminal  and bankruptcy filings in the U.S. District Courts.  While PACER requires registration and fees,  the amount charged is very reasonable at $0.08 per page for records viewed with  a $2.40 cap on dockets.  We have included  the nationwide, statewide, and district PACER links within our <a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=494">Criminal Records Directory</a>.  For those of you interested in access to  PACER information, register here: <a href="http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/register.html" target="_top">http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/register.html</a>.</p>

<h1>How do I find Federal Prisoners?</h1>

<p>We have a link to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on the main  page of our <a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=494">Criminal Records Directory</a>,  where you can search nationwide for Federal Bureau of Prisons inmates by  Register Number, DCDC Number, FBI Number, INS Number, or by first and last  name.  Or go <a href="http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/LocateInmate.jsp">here</a> to access the Federal  Bureau of Prisons database directly.</p>

<h1>What’s the difference between Corrections Records and Court Records?</h1>

<p>Corrections records come from the jails and prisons and  provide information about convicted persons (usually current inmates), but some  jurisdictions include former inmates, probationers, parolees, or even persons  sentenced to house arrest.  Court records  provide information about pending criminal cases, or closed criminal cases  resulting in a conviction.  Usually both  sources will include the date of the person’s conviction and basic information  about the charges.</p>

<h1>What’s the difference between Corrections Records included in the Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database  searches and those found within the Directory links?</h1>

<p>Corrections records found through our Directory links are  generally databases that provide information on current inmates.  The advantage to researching corrections  records through the Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database is that in many jurisdictions you can look  into the past and find an older criminal record, perhaps for an inmate who is  no longer in prison.  His or her record  lives on, and their prior sentence could be important for you to know about.</p>

<p>We recommend consulting the description for every Directory  corrections link and Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database corrections data source for specific information  on the dates covered in that jurisdiction. </p>

<h2>III. TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS</h2>

<h1>Compare before you search</h1>

<p>Please read the descriptions carefully and compare what’s  available in each state.  Generally  you’ll find more current information in the Criminal Record Directory databases,  but it will take more time to do your search.   The Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database search covers many databases at once and therefore saves  time.</p>

<h1>Different results?</h1>

<p>If the information you found through a link in our  Directory gave you more information or more current records than our  Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database, there is a good reason.  We  can’t instantaneously update every jurisdiction in our Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database—most  are updated monthly, some less often.  So  we recommend that you use our Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database to get the most coverage in a  single search—and then follow up with Directory link research to get more information about  a case or record.</p>

<h1>Can’t find the record?</h1>

<p>If you believe that there is a criminal record for that  person somewhere, but it doesn’t appear in our databases, there are several reasons.  One is that not every county or state makes  its criminal record information available.   Or it’s possible that the person may be under arrest or awaiting trial.  Wants, warrants, and arrests technically  aren’t criminal records.  Criminal  records are those where there has been a disposition or conviction.   We aren’t trying to hide records from  you—we’re trying to give you access to the most records possible.  Through our two services  we clearly offer the most complete coverage of criminal records and criminal  record sources available on the Internet.</p>

<h1>The Breakdown</h1>

<p>For more information on what is covered for each state, our  directory of criminal records is located in our <a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=494"><u>Criminal Records Directory</u></a>, and  a state-by-state listing of what’s covered in our Premium Nationwide/Statewide Criminal  Record Database is located  here: <a href="https://www.searchsystems.net/springapp/funnel/ourDatabases.do">Criminal Records Data Sources</a>.</p>

<h1>More Sex Offenders</h1>

<p>One last thing—we’ve included each state’s statewide sex  offender registry in the Criminal Records Directory.  But many states offer additional city and/or  county databases, so we have a separate directory for sex offenders here: <a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=496">SearchSystems.net Sex  Offenders Directory</a>.</p>

<h2>CALIFORNIA</h2>

<p>Issues regarding California  criminal records:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The  California Department of Justice criminal history records are NOT available to  the public. </li>
  <li>By  law, access to that information is restricted to legitimate law enforcement  purposes and authorized Applicant Agencies (youth organizations, human  resources agencies, contract employers, and in-home supportive care providers). </li>
  <li>The  public may access county court records, but only a relatively small number of California counties make  their court information available online. </li>
  <li>Court  records indicate that a case was filed, but often don’t indicate  dispositions.  Also, the information  about each case is often limited.</li>
  <li>Most  California counties have Superior (usually felony) and Municipal  (usually misdemeanor and traffic) courts.   Some counties provide information from both courts, but some only  provide Superior Court information.</li>

<h2>VI. ABOUT SEARCH SYSTEMS PUBLIC RECORDS</h2>

<p>In 1996 there were only a very small number of public record  databases on the Internet and they were difficult to find.  Google hadn’t been invented yet and AltaVista  was one of the more popular search engines.   Back then we were primarily a skiptracing (finding people) and background  search company working for law firms, financial institutions such as Wells  Fargo Bank, and title insurance companies such as Old Republic,  First American, and Fidelity National Title. In order to help our employees and  clients find public records on the Internet we developed a directory of links  to public records called pac-info.com, which later became  searchsystems.net.  </p>

<p>Since we started this service, we’ve found and added over  43,000 links to public record databases. These links are organized by  geographic location and by type of public record, and a helpful description has  been added to each one.  At Search  Systems, we add new databases each day, and we continually evaluate each link  to determine if it’s working.  If a link  is not working, we repair it immediately.  </p>

<p>We believe that Search Systems is far the best resource for  public records—especially criminal records—on the Internet.  </p>
