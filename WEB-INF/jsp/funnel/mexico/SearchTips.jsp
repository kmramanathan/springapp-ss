                  <h3><a name="searchtips" id="searchtips"></a>Search Tips:</h3>
                  <ul type="disc"><li>We recommend that          users begin searches using relatively broad terms and then narrow each         search based on actual results. It is better to begin with too many         records and narrow down your search parameters than to begin with too specific         a search term and miss altogether. </li>
                      <li>We do not recommend         searching multiple individual's names at the same time. We suggest a new         search for each individual's set of names. </li>
                      <li>In most jurisdictions         primary data set matches are to geography, by state and to name; first         name, middle, mother's maiden name, father's last name. </li>
                      <li>The use of the second         last name, mother's maiden name provides a much stronger name match than         seen in similar US         databases. However, immediate use of all four names may limit a search         down too far, particularly in jurisdictions that do not utilize all four-name         components. </li>
                      <li>You may enter the name         you are searching in any order. For example, Guillermo Hector Fuentes         Garcia can be entered as Hector Guillermo Fuentes Garcia or Guillermo         Hector Garcia Fuentes or Garcia Fuentes Guillermo Hector or Garcia         Fuentes Hector Garcia. </li>
                      <li>To         &quot;Search-within-a-search&quot; use the &quot;Refine further&quot;         search box on the Search Results Page. Enter any additional search terms to refine results within the         original results set. This option is available through multiple levels,         until a sufficient specific result is available. Example: Search         &quot;Garcia&quot; - refine with &quot;Jose&quot; - refine with &quot;Robles&quot;         - refine with &quot;Morelos&quot;. </li>
                      <li>Wildcard Searches: You         may use the asterisk * as a wildcard character. For example, to search         for variations of Hernandez you may search hernande* </li>
                      <li>Do not enter partial         characters. For example, if you enter BRO, it will not find Brown,         Brothers, Broward, etc. There is NO expansion on the terms. </li>
                      <li>When searching         hyphenated names, either enter the hyphen in the appropriate place or         preferably enter the two names without a space. </li>
                      <li>You do not have to         enter periods or commas. Periods and commas are stripped from a search         when entered. </li>
                      <li>You may search by         suffix or titles. (i.e. JR, SR, III, etc.) However, this can limit         results. For example, Hector Garcia JR will only find matches with all         three terms, Hector Garcia JR, in your results. </li>

                      <li>Our database is an index only. </li>
                      <li>Jurisdictions also         vary in name order used, please search and review results accordingly. </li>
                      <li>Initials alone are         rarely used by the Mexican courts. </li>
                      <li>The          database includes &quot;AKA's&quot;, nick-names and pseudonyms, when         available </li>
                      <li>Results, for each User         ID are maintained in a separate file for ongoing reference. Each file         can also contain related sub-files. Selected results can be         downloaded/emailed as pdf files or printed on site. </li>

                    <p>As with any public record database,    materials reflect the underlying records: </p>
                    <ul type="disc">
                      <li>In the field, data is         sometimes entered poorly, processed incorrectly and is generally not         free from defect. </li>
                    <li>If we can't read a         record clearly, we discard that record </li>
                    <li>However, when we can         clearly identify a mistake we will make a correction. </li>
                    <li>We do not change the         meaning and content found in the original record. </li>
                    <li>We do not edit files;         we provide you with as much and as accurate a version of the original         file as we can. If the original file is mislabeled we will have reported         the data to you in its mislabeled form. </li>
                    <li>Our source data is         typically from court calendars, as such, it is less likely that mistakes         are repeated in every occurrence of a case on the calendar. This is an         inherent positive value of our collection . </li>
                    <li>In many cases we         provide basic translations into English for each cause of action and         when relevant or available, provide similar notes with regard to key         hearings, verdicts, etc. </li>
                    <li>An additional strength         of our calendar based system is that actual case coverage         extends beyond initiation of our daily case coverage. Based on available         case count, case volume exceeds 50% for several years following         initiation of our daily count, e.g. If we collect 10,000 cases in the         first year of daily coverage we will see approximately 5,000 or more         cases collected from previous years as hearings on ongoing matters are         called by the court. Please see individual State data on the          Coverage  page coverage for specific additional         coverage dates. Many even older cases included, e.g. The Federal         Criminal file contains many cases from the 70's and 80's and includes         cases as far back as 1954. </li>
                    <li>In the course of         adding translations to our collection we engage local counsel to assist         in building a local dictionary of legal terms. Wherever possible we         utilize standard US legal terms. </li>
                    <li>The          collection is constantly growing; thousands of new records are         collected, compiled, translated and de-duped each day. The online database is updated at regular intervals. </li>
                    <li>Much of our process is         performed automatically by computer, however exceptions are processed by         hand, multi lingual professionals, many of whom are lawyers. </li>
                    <li>The database that you         are searching does not include every calendar entry or court hearing for         every case. The database does include the first hearing we have         collected, any hearings that describe a significant event (verdict,         judgment, etc), and the last hearing that has occurred. We have         discarded, within this collection, any additional, administrative hearings.         These files are still maintained in our primary raw data library. </li>
                    <li>Even though we have         made every effort to assure the best quality of record is provided to         our users, our records should not be relied upon as absolutely         definitive. If there are material questions with regard to our data the         best source of definitive data is each original jurisdiction, court, or         agency. </li>

                    <p>There are as many differences as there are similarities    between data collected from each international jurisdiction. We present material from each jurisdiction in as    &quot;clean&quot; and as unedited a manner as possible. It is critical that    our users view data from each jurisdiction from the correct local    perspective; when in doubt please refer to original records and/or local    counsel: </p>
                    <ul type="disc">
                      <li>The dividing line         between civil and criminal matters is not consistent. For example, in         Mexico an automobile accident causing personal injury is a crime. </li>
                      <li><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Sex offenses:   There  is a civil category “Termination of parental rights” which while broad,  is in  fact often proxy for sex offenses – as you generally need to be  sexually  dangerous for this to apply.</span></li>
                      <li>Euphemistic         descriptions are sometimes utilized. For example: &quot;Crime Against         Public Health&quot; equates to a narcotics offense. </li>
                    <li>We report offenses         conservatively; if we identify unresolved alternatives we report the         lesser offense. </li>
                    <li>Many jurisdictions         utilize plea-bargaining; convictions may not reflect the full scope of         the original charge or indictment. </li>
                    <li>Causes of action can         be complex, and may generally be reported as &quot;Civil         Litigation.&quot; </li>
                    <li>Different         international jurisdictions may enforce similar actions more         aggressively; property rights may be protected more stringently than         parental rights and vice-versa. </li>
                    <li>In some jurisdictions         the civil courts may be used for simple administrative matters. For         example, signing a lease or other contract. </li>
                    <li>Local behavior and         custom will influence causes of action. For example in Mexico a         jurisdiction with relatively high levels of kidnapping, &quot;Unlawful         Imprisonment&quot; equates to a kidnapping with a modest ransom demand. </li>
