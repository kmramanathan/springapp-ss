<h1>SearchSystems.net Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>As a result of our unique position as the premier collection of public records
databases on the Internet, SearchSytems.net is highly sensitive to the privacy
concerns of our users, and therefore strongly committed to protecting our users'
privacy every step of the way. As part of that commitment, we have outlined in
detail what information will be collected, what measures are in place to protect
that information, how that information will be used, with whom that information
may be shared and on what basis that sharing will take place. And we assure you,
the user, that we will at all times abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy
and honor the trust that you have invested in us. If you have any questions or
concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please
<a href="${contactUsUrl}">contact us</a> via our online form; we will do our best
to address your query in a timely and professional manner.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>SearchSystems.net is committed to protecting the security of your personal
information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help
protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
For example, we store the personal information you provide on limited access
computer systems which are protected by firewalls and located within controlled
facilities. Access to your personal information is limited to specific corporate
employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that
information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
When those employees leave the SearchSystems.net family, their old passwords are
revoked on an immediate basis. When we transmit highly confidential information
(such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use
of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, and through the
use of our login system.</p>

<h3>Legal Compliance</h3>

<p>SearchSystems.net shares information in order to investigate, prevent, or take
action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving
potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of
SearchSystems.net's terms of service, or as otherwise required by law.
Personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at
the time it was collected, SearchSystems.net will notify our newsletter
subscribers about the change, in addition to following the procedure outlined
above. SearchSystems.net encourages you to periodically review this Policy to
be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p>Links published on SearchSystems.net directing the user to Websites containing
public record databases, or to Websites of strategic partners do not contain
tracking technologies other than tracking clickthrough traffic. Please be aware
that SearchSystems.net is not responsible for the privacy practices of such
other sites, and that no representations are made as to personally identifiable
information gathered by those Websites themselves. We encourage our users to be
aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and
every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy
statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Children are not eligible to use our newsletter and we ask that minors (under
the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. SearchSystems.net
does not knowingly sell to anyone under the age of 18.</p>

<h3>Information Collection</h3>

<p>The level of personally identifiable information collected by SearchSystems.net
directly corresponds with the user's level of usage, as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#BASIC">Basic Users</a></li>
    <li><a href="#NEWSLETTER">Newsletter Subscribers</a></li>
    <li><a href="#PARTNER">Partner Websites</a></li>
    <li><a href="#ECOMMERCE">eCommerce Services</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

    <a name="BASIC"></a>

    <h3>Basic Users</h3>

    <p>SearchSystems.net utilizes traffic statistics as a tool to
    optimize our site's usefulness to our users. For this
    reason, as well as for security purposes (e.g., logging hack
    attacks), SearchSystems.net collects I.P. Addresses (the
    equivalent of Internet "mailing addresses"; they tell other
    computers on the Internet where to send the information you
    have requested, such as new web pages or images. IP
    addresses are not linked to personally identifiable
    information) browser type, domain names, access times,
    referring URL, and page view information of users who browse
    all areas of our Website. Individual information will not be
    shared with third parties, but aggregate site statistics may
    be shared for evaluation purposes.</p>

    <a name="NEWSLETTER"></a>

    <h3>Newsletter Subscribers</h3>
    
    <p>On a semi-regular basis (currently about twice annually),
    SearchSystems.net publishes an e-mail newsletter that tells
    all about our latest developments. If you decide to sign up
    for our newsletter,
    we will collect the e-mail to which that subscriber's
    newsletter should be sent. Our sole purpose in collecting
    this information is so that we know who we are serving and
    where to send the newsletter; this information is not at any
    time linked to other personally identifiable information,
    nor is this data shared with third parties. When you sign up
    for the newsletter, an e-mail will be sent to the provided
    address confirming your subscription and containing
    unsubscribe instructions.</p>

    <a name="PARTNER"></a>

    <h3>Partner Websites</h3>

    <p>In addition to strategic partnerships through which we offer
    premium services, SearchSystems.net also has entered into
    agreements with Partner Websites that allow our users to
    access the records provided by those Websites at an
    often-discounted rate. In such cases, as with Lexis-Nexis or
    Ancestry.com, SearchSystems.net does not actually collect
    any billing or credit card information, but merely records
    the referral to their site pursuant to our agreement with
    them, through the use of special URL's or co-branded pages.
    Once you leave SearchSystems.net and enter a Partner Website
    to subscribe for those services or merely to view their
    site, even where their site is co-branded with the
    SearchSystems.net logo, you are no longer on
    SearchSystems.net and therefore no longer covered by this
    Policy. Please peruse our Partner Websites' privacy policies
    prior to utilizing their services.</p>

    <a name="ECOMMERCE"></a>

    <h3>eCommerce Services</h3>

    <p>The only databases to which SearchSystems.net directly sells
    access to are our fee-based criminal records, bankruptcy,
	judgment, and tax lien databases.
    The pages that contain these services have a uniquely
    identifiable logo &amp; design and are accessible to
    registered users only. Individuals who wish to register for
    these services must provide their credit card information
    and other personal data required to verify the authenticity
    of the transaction. This credit card and other personal
    information will not be divulged to anybody outside of those
    individuals or institutions that must have that data in
    order to complete the transaction. This bears repetition:
    your credit card and other personal information provided to
    SearchSystems.net in order to obtain access to our fee-based
    records will not be utilized for any purpose, or divulged to
    any person or entity, unless that use or disclosure is
    necessary in order to effectuate the transaction that you
    submitted it for.</p>

    <p>Additionally, any such information provided will be
    maintained on a secure server at a locked facility where
    access is controlled by installed Biometric Palm Scanners
    and Card Key access controllers. SearchSystems.net takes
    the responsibility to guard your personal information very
    seriously, and we will take all reasonable measures to guard
    against its theft or improper disclosure.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>

<p>Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information
used for purposes not directly related to our site, at the point where we ask
for the information. For example, users who no longer wish to receive our e-mail
newsletters may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the
unsubscribe directions in the newsletter or by
<a href="${contactUsUrl}">contacting us</a>.</p>

<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

<p>SearchSystems.net will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect
company and customer feedback. You will be notified of any changes in our
Privacy Policy by a link to the updated policy on the home page, including an
icon indicating that the policy has recently changed. It is our commitment that
our users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it,
and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, at any point, we
decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from
that stated at the time it was collected, SearchSystems.net will notify our
newsletter subscribers about the change, in addition to following the procedure
outlined above. SearchSystems.net encourages you to periodically review this
Policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
