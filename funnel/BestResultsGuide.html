<h1>BEST RESULTS GUIDE</h1>

Our new advanced search features for Premium criminal records give you the ability to draw a
wider range of results.  This can help you locate harder to find records for your subject that 
might have name misspellings, name variations, date of birth errors, truncated date of birth, or 
those without any date of birth listed.  On the other hand, you will likely come across additional 
filings that may not pertain to your subject, so be careful about how wide you open the filters.

<h2>NAME FIELDS</h2>

You now have the option to input an exact first and/or last name, or a partial first and/or last 
name.  This can help you return more records with name misspellings or name variations.  The more 
truncated the input name, the higher the number of results, so use caution.<p/>

Examples:<p/>

If the "exact name" option is checked, a search for the name "Richard" will match the first name 
exactly and give you results for "Richard" only.  You won't get results for misspellings such as 
"Rickard" or nicknames such as "Dick" unless those names are listed in the database as known AKA's 
of your particular subject.<p/>

If you un-check the exact-match boxes, you may enter a partial name like "Ric."  The partial name 
search places an invisible wildcard at the end of the input name.  Therefore, if you enter "Ric" 
you'll get results for Rick, Rickie, Richie, Ricky, Ricardo, Richard, etc.<p/>

Be careful about using too few letters, as you are limited to 500 results.<p/>

<h2>DATE OF BIRTH (DOB)</h2>

We have widened our options for Date of Birth.  You may now input an exact Date of Birth, OR search 
by year of birth.  Additional options are available.<p/>

<h3>Search by Exact Date of Birth</h3> 

A search with an exact DOB helps narrow the results.  This is useful when searching a very common 
name, especially since our results are limited to 500 records.  But, by entering an exact date of 
birth, your search may actually fail to retrieve records that could belong to your subject.<p/>  

Some public agencies don't offer a day and/or month in the DOB field.  If you choose the "Exact Date 
of Birth" option and the source doesn't have numbers in the "day" and/or "month" fields, then records 
from those agencies won't appear in your results.  The solution is the "Year of Birth" option.<p/>

<h3>Search by Year of Birth</h3>

This search allows you to input a YEAR of birth only, and you may widen the search to include all 
records that match your input name and ANY year of birth within (0, 1, 2 or 3) years of your input 
year.  This casts a huge net, so be careful not to assume that all results are a match for your 
subject.  This search option is also helpful if you don't know the exact birth date.  And since the 
courts are not perfect, you may also find results where the DOB was input incorrectly.  You choose 
how wide to set the filters: 0, 1, 2 or 3 years on either side of your target year.<p/>

<h3>Include results where DOB is missing or unavailable</h3>

This option applies to Date of Birth and Year of Birth searches.  Some criminal record sources do not 
list a Date of Birth at all.  This option will provide you with results where the input name matches, 
but there is no date of birth in the record.<p/>  

This option will provide many more results for you to sort through - some of which may be your subject.  
This option may help return that critical filing you would otherwise have missed.  Be cautious about 
assuming that any of these results belong to your search subject.  Without a date of birth there is no 
easy way to cross-reference the record to determine if it's a valid result.<p/>

<h2>MIDDLE INITIAL OPTION</h2>

If you input a middle initial in this field, your search results will include records where:

<ul>
<li>There is a match on the single letter that you input.</li>
<li>The middle name starts with the letter you entered.</li>
<li>The middle name is empty in our database.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>THE BEST WAY TO SEARCH</h2>

There is no "right way" to set these advanced search features.  We recommend our users adjust the 
filters on a case-by-case basis.  Take into consideration the commonality of the name, the population 
of the area you are searching, the "500 record" result limit, and your own available time.<p/>  

If the name isn't particularly common and you know the exact birth date, try searching with the exact 
name, exact birth date, and "include results where DOB is missing or unavailable" option.<p/>

As to common names, our rule of thumb is that if we've never heard of or read about the name before, 
then it's probably uncommon.  Think about how many people you've met with that name.  Check the phone 
directory or do a Google search and put the name in quotes-if you get many pages of results, then 
there's a good chance that it's a common name.<p/>

<h2>TOO MANY RESULTS?</h2>

If you get too many results in your search, you receive the first 500 and you are charged for the 
search.  We aren't able to show you results beyond the first 500.  Here are some suggestions you 
may use to limit your results:<p/> 

<ul>
<li>Run a single state search, rather than a Nationwide Search.</li>
<li>Use an exact-name search.  Make sure the exact-name boxes are checked.</li>
<li>Use full date of birth.</li>
<li>Disable the option to "Include results where DOB is missing or unavailable."</li>
<li>Input the correct middle initial.</li>
</ul>

Please don't forget that we have to thousands of free criminal record, inmate, arrest, booking, and sex offender databases. You'll find those here: <a href="http://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/Free_Public_Records_by_Type_of_Record/Criminal_Records/" target="_blank">Search Systems Criminal Record Directory</a>, along with information on how to order "Official" and "Certified" state criminal histories from state agencies.<p/>
