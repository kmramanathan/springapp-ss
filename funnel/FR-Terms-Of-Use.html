By reading the agreement and checking the box next  to “I have read &amp; agree to the User Agreement” at the bottom of this page  and pressing the 'Make your payment &amp; Start Searching' button, you agree to  be bound by this Agreement; doing so constitutes your acceptance of all of the  terms contained therein. If you do not agree with any term or condition of the  Agreement, you are not authorized to become a registered subscriber to  SearchSystems.net's services. Should you provide information for the credit  card that you wish to use to pay for unlimited access to our Public Records  Directory and databases, you will be allowed unlimited access to the public  records directory found on SearchSystems.net and access to our Flat Rate  databases located at https://www.searchsystems.net/springapp/flatrate/FRLanding.do.</p>
                <p><br>
                  <strong>User Agreement</strong><br>
                  </p>
                <p>PART 1(a):  I understand that by purchasing a Find People  Flat Rate Plan, I can perform up to 100 searches of the Find People Flat Rate  database within each 24-hour period of my Plan’s term.  I have purchased one of the four types of  Find People Flat Rate Plans at the following rates:  1 Day $9.95; 1 Week $14.95; 1 Month $19.95; 1  Year $149.00.<br>
                  </p>
                <p>PART 1(b):  I understand that by purchasing a Criminal  Records Flat Rate Plan, I can perform up to 100 searches of the Criminal Record  Flat Rate database within each 24-hour period of my Plan’s term.  I have purchased one of the four types of  Criminal Record Flat Rate Plans at the following rates:  1 Day $19.95; 1 Week $49.95; 1 Month $69.95;  1 Year $499.00.<br>
                  </p>
                <p>PART 1(c):  I understand that by purchasing a Combined  Flat Rate Plan, I can perform up to 100 searches of the Find People Flat Rate  database within each 24-hour period of my Plan’s term.  I can also perform up to 100 searches of the  Criminal Records Flat Rate database within each 24-hour period of my Plan’s  term.  I have purchased one of the four  types of Combined Flat Rate Plans at the following rates:  1 Day $24.95; 1 Week $59.95; 1 Month $79.95;  1 Year $549.00.<br>

                <p>PART 2:  I understand that if I attempt to perform  more than 100 searches of any Flat Rate database within one 24-hour period, my  access may be restricted until the following day.  I also understand that if I perform less than  100 searches within one 24-hour period, there will be no “search credits”  carried over to the following day.  <br>
                  </p>
                <p>I understand that after my  Flat Rate term has expired, I will not be able to access the databases, nor the  main SearchSystems.net website (unless I have a prior membership to the  website).  I understand that once my Flat  Rate Plan expires, I will have the option to purchase additional Flat Rate  Plans, or purchase an annual membership to SearchSystems.net.<br>
                  </p>
                <p>PART  3:  I understand that once the fee is  charged to my checking or credit card account, unless evidence satisfactory to  SearchSystems.net is presented to the Website that the charges were incurred as  the result of identity theft/credit card fraud by a person other than the  actual cardholder, no refund will be granted for part or all of that fee. I  understand that if I try to circumvent either of these policies via the use of  a credit card &quot;chargeback&quot;, legal proceeding or other means, I will  be liable for the full value of the disputed Flat Rate Plan  fee, as well as attorney's fees, and  reasonable costs. I also understand that the Flat Rate Plan may be canceled by  me at any time, but no refund will be made for unused subscription periods or  unused searches.<br>
                  </p>
                <p>PART 4. I understand that  some or all of the information reported by SearchSystems.net or obtainable from  SearchSystems.net's databases may constitute personal data that may be  regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the full text of which can  be found at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcra.htm">http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcra.htm</a>.

  <br>
                  Under no circumstances shall SearchSystems.net be liable to any user on account  of that user's use or misuse of or reliance on the Website. Arising from any  claim relating to this agreement or the subject matter hereof such limitation  of liability shall apply to prevent recovery of direct, indirect, incidental,  consequential, special, exemplary, and punitive damages whether such claim is  based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if  SearchSystems.net has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Such  limitation of liability shall apply whether the damages arise from use or  misuse of and reliance on SearchSystems.net, from inability to use  SearchSystems.net, or from the interruption, suspension, or termination of  SearchSystems.net (including such damages incurred by third parties). This  limitation shall also apply with respect to damages incurred by reason of other  services or goods received through or advertised on SearchSystems.net or  received through any links provided in the Website, as well as by reason of any  information or advice received through or advertised on the Website or received  through any links provided in the Website.

  <br>
                  Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of  liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and  exclusions may not apply to me. <br>
  <br>

  <br>
                  This User Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the  laws of the State of California,  without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or my actual state or  country of residence.
