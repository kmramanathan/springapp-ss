    <td><h1 align="left" class="style59">The SearchSystems.net Guide to Finding People</h1>
      <p align="left" class="style27">Locating  people may be challenging, but it can be easy and fun.  Think of it as a puzzle with more than one  solution.  The trick is in knowing where  to start and what steps to follow.  Here  are some basic tools to help you locate someone:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>Directory Assistance</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">Before the  Internet became popular the easiest way to find someone was with Directory  Assistance.  All you had to do was pick  up a phone and dial.  It still  works—though less so each year as more and more people request unlisted or  non-published numbers.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">  </p>
      <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>SearchSystems.net Find People  Database</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">Another  quick, easy, and informative place to start is with our <a href="https://www.searchsystems.net/springapp/findpeople/searchLanding.do">Find  People</a> service.  Search a name and  get full name, age, city, and state results for free.  For $1.75 (members pay $1.00) you can get  address, date of birth and telephone number details for your results (when  available).  Because each record shows  the date the address was last reported, this is a great starting point to  identify the right person and find their most recent address.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">However,  this alone does not guarantee that the person still resides at the most  recently reported address as he or she may have subsequently moved.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">If you have  done a Find People search and want to verify an address, or if you would rather  skip the Find People database and move straight to other research methods,  check out some of the other tools below.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>Free Public Records</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">No country  does a better job of providing easy and inexpensive access to public record  information than the United    States. The amount of online information  available is dizzying.  And no web site  has done a better job of finding and organizing access to these databases than 
        SearchSystems.net.  </p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">We’ve been  searching for and building our directory of public record databases since 1996,  so feel free to use them to aid you in your search.  Membership is just $29.95 per year.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">Where to  start?  Here are some suggestions: </p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">The most  useful government-held data about citizens is kept at the county level.  To find what public record databases are  available in your county, go here: <a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=11">http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=11</a> and go to the state and then county you’d like to search.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">Know the  name of the city, but not the county?   Try this tool from MIT: <a href="http://stuff.mit.edu/geo">http://stuff.mit.edu/geo</a>.<br />
        Simply type  the name of the city and state, (e.g. Cleveland,   OH), and it will tell you the  county name.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">Once you  find what’s available for your county, check each database to see which ones  might be helpful.  Here are the ones we  find most useful:</p>
      <p class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left" class="style27"><strong> 1) Property Records</strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style27">Many counties will still allow you to search by name, as  well as by address, or parcel number.   Access to name searches is becoming less common though.  But if you have an address you can still use  it to check to see if the person you’re trying to find still owns it.  Or if the county provides owner histories,  you can tell from that when that person might have moved.  Some areas (such as Virginia and many of the New England states) provide property record information  at the local level, so don’t forget to check what’s available for your city as  well.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>2) Recorded Documents</strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style27">Recorded Documents are generally considered to be deeds,  mortgages, liens (of all sorts), and judgments, but the counties that provide  access to them often provide so much more.   You can find military discharges, bonds, trusts, child support  enforcement, dba’s, power of attorney filings, financing statements, trusts,  partnership documents, leases, and wills.   Some counties also provide birth, death and marriage certificates, and  quite a few will give you copies of the documents online—for free. Try it  yourself at the Maricopa County, Arizona Recorder’s database: <a href="http://recorder.maricopa.gov/recdocdata/" target="_blank">http://recorder.maricopa.gov/recdocdata/</a>.  Or try the Cuyahoga County, Ohio Recorder’s  offering found here: <a href="http://recorder.cuyahogacounty.us./Searchs/GeneralSearchs.aspx" target="_blank">http://recorder.cuyahogacounty.us./Searchs/GeneralSearchs.aspx</a>.  Compare the two and you’ll find that many of  the documents they provide are the same, but each provides additional  categories that the other doesn’t offer.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style27">Our SearchSystems.net Directory of public record links  includes a category for <a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=751">Recorded  Documents</a>, organized by state and county, to help you locate the  link to the appropriate clerk-recorder database.  Many counties offer searches free of charge  (document copies often cost extra).</p>
        <p align="left" class="style27">If your subject owns property, you can verify the ownership  and address using the clerk-recorder’s records.   If the subject is renting, you may still be able to bring up owner  information.  Try Directory Assistance to  locate a phone number for your subject, or for the property owner.  A friendly phone call may provide the next  clue in your quest.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>3) Voter Registration</strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style27">Some counties offer free websites to verify voter  registration.  This can help you match a  name and address.  We have links to these  sites in our <u><a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=1049">Voters</a></u> category on our Directory, organized by state and county.  Some states even have a statewide voter  registration database, making your search that much faster.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>4) Professional  Licenses</strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style27">If you know that your subject is a contractor, accountant,  attorney, doctor, security guard, or other licensed professional, you have  another tool at your disposal.  Many  occupations require licensing at the state level.  Most states provide free online databases for  all types of professions.  We have links  to these databases in the <u><a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=816">Licenses</a></u> category  on our Directory.  A search here may give  you a current home or office address, and possibly a phone number for your  subject.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>Relatives, Roommates, Neighbors</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">Your “Find People” or other  research results may include relatives, roommates or neighbors.  Most people want to help others reconnect, so  a phone call or letter to one of these people might produce the missing link if  you have not been successful in locating your subject.  Try Directory Assistance if you don’t have a  current phone number for a relative or friend.   Or try any of the other tools described here.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>Post Office</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">You can  also put the postal service to work for you.  Simply write a letter to your subject at the  last-known address and below your return address, write &quot;Address Service  Requested.”  You may also write it above  the delivery address, to the left of or below the postage area.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">This  instructs the post office to send your envelope BACK TO YOU if the address  written on the envelope is no longer current for the subject and they still  have a forwarding address.  If there is a  forwarding address, <strong>the Post Office is  supposed to put the new address on a sticker, put it on your envelope and  return it to you.</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">The Postal Service does charge a fee for this, which you pay when you  receive the new address.  </p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">If the post office for that address isn’t far away, you can go there and  complete a “Freedom of Information Act Request Form” to obtain the new address.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">Without  that “Address Forwarding Information Requested” notice, the Post Office simply  forwards mail on to the recipient and the sender has no idea it has been  redirected to a different address.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">For more  information from the USPS about this topic, go here: <a href="http://www.usps.com/ncsc/addressservices/moveupdate/ace.htm">http://www.usps.com/ncsc/addressservices/moveupdate/ace.htm</a></p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27"><strong>Other Avenues</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">There are so many more ways to locate people that it’s  best to just explore our web site to see what you can find.  Try starting here:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27"><a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=397" target="_top">Search Public Records by Type of Record</a></p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">See if you can find marriage and/or divorce records.  Try searching “Unclaimed Property” if you  don’t know where to start as that may give you an old address.  Try court and criminal records, business  filings (corporations, dba’s, LLC’s), or Uniform Commercial Code filings.  Some cities and counties provide building  inspection databases, or even online access to utility information.  Be sure to check death records as well: <a href="http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=478">http://www.searchsystems.net/list.php?nid=478</a>.  It’s unfortunate news, but you want to check  every source that you can. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">There are many more ways that you can find people.  Try calling the local moving companies, or  check (nicely) with neighbors.  If the  person you’re looking for lived in a rural area, try the local grocery store or  bar (we found someone once who lived in a cave in the Sierra Nevada Mountains—his  buddies at the local bar were happy to tell us how to reach him).</p>
      <p align="left" class="style27">And keep checking back at SearchSystems.net.  We continually hand-search, add (and verify)  our links to public record databases daily.   We’ll also be adding more helpful guides and additional useful “Premium”  databases to make it easier for you to find the information you need. </p>
