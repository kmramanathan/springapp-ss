              <h3 class="style59">What  are your sources?</h3>
              <p class="style71">Our information comes from:  State corrections departments, state and county court disposed felony,  misdemeanor, and traffic records; statewide registered offender registries; Department  of Public Safety records; violent offender registries, Methamphetamine  registries; State Medicaid exclusion lists; Casino exclusion lists; SEC  enforcement actions; and State misconduct registries.  Sources vary for each state. For a complete  listing of all of our sources, <a href="https://www.searchsystems.net/springapp/funnel/ourDatabases.do">click  here</a> and for details on each international, national, state, and county  source.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">How  current is the information? </h3>
              <p class="style71">An online search is only as  accurate as the agency reporting the data.&nbsp; In addition to coverage, our <a href="https://www.searchsystems.net/springapp/funnel/ourDatabases.do">Criminal  Records Data Sources</a> page also lists the update frequency for each  jurisdiction.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">What  information will I find? </h3>
              <p class="style71">Each jurisdiction provides  a different amount of information and utilizes different sources. Results may  include charges, case information, gender, race, and address. Court Records may  include case information, charges, and/or case records.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">How  much does it cost to search the Premium Criminal Record Database? </h3>
              <p class="style71">Nationwide searches are  $14.95 each and Statewide searches are $9.95 each.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">Do  I have to become a Member to use the database? Are there additional fees? </h3>
              <p class="style71">Use of our <a href="http://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/Free_Public_Records_by_Type_of_Record/Criminal_Records/">free  public records directory</a> does not require registration or fees.  Use of our Premium database does require  per-search fees and registration.  There  are no signup or membership fees - you pay only for your search.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">Which  of the two searches is right for me?</h3>
              <p class="style71">Personal searches are for  personal use only, and do not need to adhere to FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting  Act) laws.  The personal search cannot be  used for purposes covered by the FCRA: employment purposes; tenant screening;  by court order or subpoena; applications for insurance; business transactions;  consumer evaluation; license eligibility; or to evaluate a potential investor,  service, or insurer.  If the purpose of  your search is FCRA related you MUST use the  Background Screening search  form and select the legal reason for the search. </p>
              <h3 class="style59">How  is this different from your free criminal records directory? </h3>
              <p class="style71">Our <a href="http://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/Free_Public_Records_by_Type_of_Record/Criminal_Records/">Criminal  Records Directory</a> is simply the best resource for free criminal records on  the Internet.  Not only do we provide you  with a list of available free resources in each state, but you also get access  to or information on how to do an “Official” or “Certified” criminal history  search in each state.  The big advantage  is that you can save money with direct access to federal, state, and county  corrections, inmate, court, and registered offender databases. </p>
              <p class="style71"> <br>
                However, criminals don’t  stop at state borders, so your search should cover the largest area.  The advantage of our Premium criminal record  database is that it will search over 400 million records across the nation at  once and give you instant results.  You  get more information and save yourself a considerable amount of time.  Even better is that once you have results  from our Premium database you can then go to right to the source in our  Directory and get additional information such as court dockets, appearances,  fines, fines, and document copies on a criminal case.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">I  am an employer.  May I use this criminal  data to make a hiring decision? </h3>
              <p class="style71">Yes, provided you do two  things: Make sure you use our  Background Screening search form, rather than  the Personal Search form; also, be sure you have notified the job applicant of  your intent to perform the criminal background check.  Per the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/031224fcra.pdf">FCRA</a>, if a potential  employer decides to make a hiring decision based on any information that has  been provided to them, they must notify the consumer.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">I  know there is a criminal record for this person. Why isn’t it appearing in my  results? </h3>
              <p class="style71">If you believe that there  is a criminal record for that person somewhere, but it doesn’t appear in our  databases, there are several reasons.&nbsp; Not every county and state makes  its criminal record information available, and if we do cover that location, it  is possible they did not provide the data to us due to an error or a regulation  under state law.  Or it’s possible that the person may  be under arrest or awaiting trial.&nbsp; Wants, warrants, and arrests  technically aren’t criminal records.&nbsp; Criminal records are those where  there has been a disposition or conviction.   To access arrests, warrants, and criminal court records not available  through our Premium service, you can try using our <a href="http://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/Free_Public_Records_by_Type_of_Record/Criminal_Records/">criminal  records directory</a> and our <a href="http://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/Free_Public_Records_by_Type_of_Record/Criminal_Wants_and_Warrants/">wants  and warrants directory</a>.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">Where  do I find Wants, Warrants, and Arrests? </h3>
              <p class="style71">Most wants, warrants, and  arrests aren’t technically criminal records as there hasn’t been a conviction  or disposition yet, so you won’t find those in our Premium Criminal Record  Database.&nbsp; The place to find arrests is in our <a href="http://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/Free_Public_Records_by_Type_of_Record/Criminal_Records/">Criminal  Records Directory</a>.&nbsp; The place to find wants and warrants is in our <a href="http://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/Free_Public_Records_by_Type_of_Record/Criminal_Wants_and_Warrants/">wants  and warrants directory</a>.  Browse by  state for links to national, state, county, and city lists and databases.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">Where  do I find Federal Court Records? </h3>
              <p class="style71">Federal court records are  available from the U.S. PACER system, which covers civil, criminal and  bankruptcy filings in the U.S. District Courts.&nbsp; While PACER requires  registration and fees, the amount charged is very reasonable at $0.08 per page  (with a price increase to $0.10 per page on April 1, 2012).&nbsp; We have  included the nationwide, statewide, and district PACER links within our <a href="http://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/Free_Public_Records_by_Type_of_Record/Criminal_Records/">Criminal  Records Directory</a>.&nbsp; For those of you interested in access to PACER  information, register here: <a href="http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/register.html" target="_top">http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/register.html</a>.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">How  do I find Federal Prisoners? </h3>
              <p class="style71">Go <a href="http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/LocateInmate.jsp">here</a> to access the Federal  Bureau of Prisons database directly.</p>
              <h3 class="style59">What’s  the difference between Corrections Records and Court Records? </h3>
              <p class="style71">Corrections records come  from the jails and prisons and provide information about convicted persons  (usually current inmates), but some jurisdictions include former inmates,  probationers, parolees, or even persons sentenced to house arrest.&nbsp; Court  records provide information about pending criminal cases, or closed criminal  cases resulting in a conviction.&nbsp; Usually both sources will include the  date of the person’s conviction and basic information about the charges.</p>
              <h3 class="style71">                <strong class="style59">Do you provide  juvenile records?</strong> </h3>
              <p class="style71">                Juvenile records are  protected and are not part of our database.</p>
              <h3 class="style71">                <strong class="style59">What are the  public record rules in my state?</strong> </h3>
              <p class="style71">                Go to our <a href="http://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/">home page</a> and select your  state.  At the top of the page you’ll  find a description of your state’s public record rules, how the state court  system is organized, and helpful tips for you on how to find the information  you need.</p>
